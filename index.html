							<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
							<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out a timeline of some of the projects I've worked on over the past couple decades! I have organized them roughly in order of most recent to oldest, however some of the dates may not be exact, and some projects took longer from start to completion than others. If you have any questions or would like more information or source code for the projects you see here, most are available on request!</p>
              <p>I have quite a few more projects to add, some dating back to around 1999, so check back later for more content!</p>
              <p>Because I know your time is valuable, use these filters to quickly narrow down what you'd like to see!</p>

				<h2>AWS EC2 Shutdown Script</h2>
				<p>This bash script was written over the course of a week from 3/14/23 to 3/21/23 for the DevOps portion of <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaunchCode</a>'s Cleared Talent CodeCamp. The script was designed to help automate the process of shutting down any Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances at the end of class to avoid incurring any extra charges if students kept them running at the end of the day.</p>
				<p>The script works by first checking to ensure that the student has installed the aws command-line program, then queries a list of all known aws servers for any running EC2 instances. If it finds any instances not in the "stopped" state, it issues the stop command, then sleeps for a few seconds, and queries again until all instances have stopped.</p>
				<p>I also created a detailed usage guide for students on how to obtain and execute the script, distributed as a PDF document.</p>

					  <h2>PDF2XLS: A PDF to Excel Spreadsheet Converter</h2>
					  <p>This project was started around mid to late September 2022 to help my brother with his job. Every day he receives 2-3 PDF formatted reports which are generated by a (very old) piece of software called VSE2PDF 04.03.01  BETA-B. These files conform to the specification of PDF-1.3. He must then manually parse multiple pages of PDF data and re-key the information into an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
					  <p>To help him speed up the process, as well as avoid keying mistakes from typos, I made a script for him that runs via Windows Scripting Host using JavaScript.</p>
					  <p>When executed, the script shows a file selector dialog (pictured in the image since there aren't really any other graphics to demonstrate), and then allows the user to select a PDF document. It then parses the document, using regex to find specific strings and patterns to confirm whether the document is, in fact, one of his reports and not just a random PDF document.
						Once the script determines it has found the correct document type, it extracts the information which is relevant to what he needs to do.</p>
					  <p>Then, it base64 decodes an embedded (blank) XLSX file, extracts the contents to a temporary folder, updates the sheets with the information, re-zips the file, and moves it to the folder where the script was executed from, as well as cleaning up the newly created temp folders. Per his request, it also automatically launches the newly created file in Microsoft Excel.</p>
					  <p>This project involved learning several new concepts, including the internal working and file structure of PDF documents, XLSX spreadsheet data, base64 encoding/decoding, and run-length encoding (needed to decode some of the sections of the PDF files).</p>
					  <p>Source code may be provided upon request, however it is rather obfuscated and specialized for his specific work, so may not be relevant for many people.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Blender Render Farm</h2>
							<p>Project started around 6/19/2021. This project involved configuring hardware and python scripts on a total of 20 nodes of <a href="https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-mc1-my-cluster-one-with-32-cpu-cores-and-8gb-dram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odroid-MC1</a> "My Cluster One" (5 units, 4 nodes each). Each unit has 32 CPU cores and 8 GB of DRAM, so the total cluster has 160 CPU cores and 40 GB DRAM. The units are mounted to a small table, underneath which is a 24 port Gig-speed switch and 2x 5V 60A Power Supply units to power the cluster.</p>
              <p>The node configuration was done via ssh and Linux terminal commands, as the nodes do not include any display output port, only a UART connection for debugging purposes. I later also added a Raspberry Pi Zero-W to control 2 LED panels to display status messages (not pictured).</p>
              <p>The purpose of the cluster, known as the "Tiny Potato Collective" due to being both physically small and not super powerful, is to offload the work of rendering 3D images created with <a href="https://blender.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blender</a> from my main PC. Rendering images and animations can take a long time, so this way I'm free to work on other things while the cluster works in the background.</p>
              <p>The Python script runs on another machine and delegates the next frame to be rendered to the next available machine so that the load is balanced as evenly as possible across all nodes for maximum efficiency.</p>

							<h2>Pi-Hole Network-Wide Ad blocker</h2>
							<p>This project was made so that myself and my roommates would have some relief from the constant barrage of ads and pop-ups online. I learned about flashing an operating system to a microSD card, configuring Linux packages via ssh and the command line, and installing and configuring a TFT touch screen display. I also added a few custom scripts as well as cron jobs to automate updates and system reboots to keep the Pi running smoothly.</p>
              <p>The project consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ running Pi-Hole software to detect and block ads, as well as act as the DNS server for my entire home network.

							<h2>Windows Police Pro Malware Remover</h2>
							<p>This was a project which I made out of necessity around September 2009. My wife at the time had a PC which became infected with the Windows Police Pro malware.</p>
              <p>The malware was fairly new and caused a lot of problems, including making normal executable ".exe" files unable to run as normal. I wrote a few Windows batch file scripts and registry files ".reg", as well as some VBScript commands to help restore the system. There was a command line version as well as later a Windows GUI version of the program available. I also hosted a website which had several updates as I added new features and learned more about how to remove this malware.</p>
              <p>The website is not currently being hosted anymore as by now, most major antivirus programs easily detect and remove this malware, but at the time my program was downloaded a few hundred times and I even received a few donations from some people I was able to help to remove the malware from their systems. </p>
