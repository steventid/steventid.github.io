							<h1>Welcome!</h1>
							<p class="major">Thanks for taking the time to check out a timeline of some of the projects I've worked on over the past couple decades! I have organized them roughly in order of most recent to oldest, however some of the dates may not be exact, and some projects took longer from start to completion than others. If you have any questions or would like more information or source code for the projects you see here, most are available on request!</p>
              <p>I have quite a few more projects to add, some dating back to around 1999, so check back later for more content!</p>

							<h2>Godot Module Template Maker</h2>
							<p>Project started approximately 4/26/2022. This project is written as a C++ console application, and its main purpose is to assist with writing the boilerplate code for custom modules for the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
              <p>Some notable functions include checking whether or not a file or directory exists, backing up modules, and creating or deleting files from the disk.</p>

							<h2>Morpheus of Mars</h2>
							<p>This project was my entry for the <a href="https://ldjam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ludum Dare 50</a> game jam, which ran from 4/1 to 4/4/2022. This is a real-time strategy style game which was created in 72 hours using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot Engine</a></p>
              <p>Some new concepts I was learning about at the time include vector field pathfinding, which helps multiple objects to pathfind to a goal faster than some other methods. You can read more about the technical specifications on Leif Erkenbrach's blog post from 2013 <a href="https://leifnode.com/2013/12/flow-field-pathfinding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

							<h2>Blender Render Farm</h2>
							<p>Project started around 6/19/2021. This project involved configuring hardware and python scripts on a total of 20 nodes of <a href="https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-mc1-my-cluster-one-with-32-cpu-cores-and-8gb-dram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odroid-MC1</a> "My Cluster One" (5 units, 4 nodes each). Each unit has 32 CPU cores and 8 GB of DRAM, so the total cluster has 160 CPU cores and 40 GB DRAM. The units are mounted to a small table, underneath which is a 24 port Gig-speed switch and 2x 5V 60A Power Supply units to power the cluster.</p>
              <p>The node configuration was done via ssh and Linux terminal commands, as the nodes do not include any display output port, only a UART connection for debugging purposes. I later also added a Raspberry Pi Zero-W to control 2 LED panels to display status messages (not pictured).</p>
              <p>The purpose of the cluster, known as the "Tiny Potato Collective" due to being both physically small and not super powerful, is to offload the work of rendering 3D images created with <a href="https://blender.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blender</a> from my main PC. Rendering images and animations can take a long time, so this way I'm free to work on other things while the cluster works in the background.</p>
              <p>The Python script runs on another machine and delegates the next frame to be rendered to the next available machine so that the load is balanced as evenly as possible across all nodes for maximum efficiency.</p>

							<h2>Bringing Home the Bacon</h2>
							<p>This project was my entry for the <a href="https://ldjam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ludum Dare 46</a> game jam, which happened in April 2020. This game is a single screen resource management style game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot Engine</a>. The player must keep everything on the farm alive for 60 in-game days (1 hour in-game is approximately 6 seconds).</p>
              <p>The player must manage their energy while also gathering resources needed to feed a dragon and repair their farmhouse.</p>

							<h2>Space Shipping</h2>
							<p>This project was my entry for the <a href="https://ldjam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ludum Dare 42</a> game jam, which happened in August 2018. This was my first game jam ever, and I made everything using <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/gamemaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamemaker Studio</a>.</p>
              <p>This game includes elements of Tetris for manipulating the cargo as different shaped boxes, loading them onto your space ship, and delivering them to the destination.</p>

							<h2>Zombie Panic! Source</h2>
							<p>Between approximately February 2011 through late 2016 I did not have many programming projects, as I was working a full time job. However, in my free time I was hosting a sever for some friends to play a multiplayer first-person zombie apocalypse survival game called Zombie Panic! Source.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, other than just the few scripts and map files from the old server, it is no longer actively being hosted by myself</p>

							<h2>Windows Police Pro Malware Remover</h2>
							<p>This was a project which I made out of necessity around September 2009. My wife at the time had a PC which became infected with the Windows Police Pro malware.</p>
              <p>The malware was fairly new and caused a lot of problems, including making normal executable ".exe" files unable to run as normal. I wrote a few Windows batch file scripts and registry files ".reg", as well as some VBScript commands to help restore the system. There was a command line version as well as later a Windows GUI version of the program available. I also hosted a website which had several updates as I added new features and learned more about how to remove this malware.</p>
              <p>The website is not currently being hosted anymore as by now, most major antivirus programs easily detect and remove this malware, but at the time my program was downloaded a few hundred times and I even received a few donations from some people I was able to help to remove the malware from their systems. </p>
